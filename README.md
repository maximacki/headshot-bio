## Bio 

### Job titles

Primary:
Consultant
Ellison Institute of Technology â€“ Pathogena

Full: 
Consultant, Ellison Institute of Technology â€“ Pathogena
Co-Founder & Co-Director, One HealthTech
Co-Founder & Chair, Data Science for Health Equity
Affiliate Researcher, University of Oxford & Alan Turing Institute

### Short bio (<100 words)
Maxine works at the Ellison Institute of Technology, supporting strategy and delivery across global health data activities within EIT Pathogena. Alongside her role, she leads two global communities â€” One HealthTech and Data Science for Health Equity â€” and continues academic work with the University of Oxford and the Alan Turing Institute. Her work spans research, delivery and community building, with a focus on making health innovation more inclusive, practical and grounded in how systems actually work. She's especially drawn to complex challenges that sit between disciplines â€” and enjoys finding collaborative, thoughtful ways through them.


### Medium-length bio (~250 words)
Maxine works at the Ellison Institute of Technology, where she supports strategy and delivery across a range of global health data activities within EIT Pathogena. Her work focuses on making data more useful, inclusive and implementable within complex health systems. 
Outside of this role, Maxine is a long-time community builder and researcher. She founded One HealthTech, a grassroots organisation promoting diversity and inclusion in health innovation, and co-founded Data Science for Health Equity, a global community of practice focused on using the most effective data science approaches to advance health equity. She also holds academic affiliations with the University of Oxford and the Alan Turing Institute, where her research explores the responsible use of health data â€” particularly for underrepresented groups and underexplored contexts.
Previously, Maxine led the Â£25M Diverse Data Programme at Genomics England, and has worked with organisations including the World Health Organization, Roche Diagnostics and The Health Foundation. She holds a PhD in health data science from UCL, and degrees in health policy and biomedical science from LSE, LSHTM and UCL.
Sheâ€™s especially interested in work that cuts across systems and sectors â€” and in helping move it forward with clarity, collaboration and as much joy as is reasonably possible. She also really, really likes fancy dress.

### Long bio (~500 words)
Maxine works at the Ellison Institute of Technology, where she supports the strategy and delivery of global health data activities within EIT Pathogena â€” a major programme addressing infectious disease innovation. Her focus is on ensuring that data and AI are used in ways that are not only technically robust but also inclusive, implementable, and grounded in the messy realities of health systems.

Beyond her role at EIT, Maxine is a long-time community builder and researcher, committed to collaboration across disciplines, sectors and geographies. She is the founder of One HealthTech, a grassroots community that supports diverse leadership in health innovation, and the co-founder of Data Science for Health Equity (DSxHE), a global community of practice advancing equity in health data science. These communities create spaces where inclusion is embedded into the infrastructure of innovation â€” not treated as an afterthought â€” and where technical rigour and social impact go hand in hand.

Maxine also holds research affiliations with the University of Oxford, the Alan Turing Institute and the Centre for Personalised Medicine. Her research focuses on how AI and health data is used â€” and misused â€” particularly in underrepresented populations and overlooked contexts. Sheâ€™s especially interested in where ethical, technical and systemic challenges collide, and how research can support more responsible, equitable innovation in practice.

Prior to joining EIT, Maxine led the Â£25M Diverse Data Programme at Genomics England â€” one of the largest national efforts to embed equity into genomic research, policy and infrastructure. In that role, she shaped community engagement models, analysis pipelines and institutional collaborations aimed at making the UKâ€™s genomic ecosystem more representative and impactful. Earlier in her career, she worked with the World Health Organisation on AI policy, supported innovation strategy at Roche Diagnostics, and contributed to health data research at NHS England and The Health Foundation.

Her academic background spans science and policy: she holds a PhD in health data science from UCL, where her thesis applied machine learning to electronic health records to detect early signs of dementia, and MSc degrees in health policy from LSE and LSHTM, alongside a BSc in biomedical sciences from UCL.

Maxine has contributed to national conversations on health and technology across outlets including BBC News, Radio 4â€™s Today Programme, Wired, Sifted and the Financial Times. Her work has been recognised by Forbes 30 Under 30, Computer Weeklyâ€™s Most Influential Women in UK Tech (multiple years), and a range of other awards for leadership in digital health. She has held governance and advisory roles with DeepMind Healthâ€™s Independent Review Board, the British Computer Society and Eastern AHSN. She is also an Associate Editor at BMJ AI and Digital Health, and a Fellow of the Sciana Health Leaders Network.

Whether sheâ€™s working on strategy, science or systems, Maxine tries to bring curiosity, energy and care to her work. Sheâ€™s drawn to challenges that call for systems leadership â€” those that need collaboration across disciplines, institutions and perspectives. She aims to use joy and levity to work through complex issues. She also really, really likes fancy dress.
